This dashboard was developed to assist in the analysis and optimization of investments in a set of popular financial assets such as Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Tesla (TSLA).

**Objectives:**
- **Performance Analysis:** Evaluate how these assets have performed over time in terms of return and risk.
- **Portfolio Optimization:** Determine the optimal allocation of each asset to maximize risk-adjusted return.
- **Sensitivity Analysis:** Understand how different scenarios, such as changes in the risk-free rate, affect portfolio performance.

**Indicators Used:**
1. **Expected Annual Return:** Weighted average of expected annual returns for the selected assets.
2. **Annual Volatility:** Indicates the degree of fluctuation in returns over time, reflecting risk.
3. **Sharpe Ratio:** Measures risk-adjusted return, considering the risk-free rate as a benchmark.
4. **VaR 95% (Value at Risk):** Estimates the worst expected loss with 95% confidence, providing a measure of risk.

**Questions Answered:**
- **What was the performance of the portfolio over time?** The cumulative performance chart shows how the investment evolved.
- **How is risk and return distributed among different assets?** The distribution of returns and risk provides insights into optimal asset allocation.
- **How does portfolio performance vary with different levels of risk-free rate?** Sensitivity analysis helps understand the impact of changes in the risk-free rate on the portfolio.

**Conclusions:**
- **Positive Results:** Indicate good portfolio performance with returns higher than expected and a positive Sharpe Ratio. ðŸ“ˆ
- **Negative Results:** Suggest the portfolio may not be optimized for the assumed risk, with returns below expectations or a lower Sharpe Ratio. ðŸ“‰

# Explanatory and Methodological Notes
st.subheader('Explanatory and Methodological Notes')
st.write("""
In this dashboard, we used a portfolio optimization-based methodology to calculate performance and risk metrics. Historical asset prices were obtained from Yahoo Finance, and daily returns were calculated based on these prices. Portfolio optimization was performed using the minimization method to maximize the Sharpe Ratio, considering the trade-off between risk and return.

Assumptions include the normal distribution or close to it of asset returns and market efficiency in reflecting past and present information. It is important to note that past results do not guarantee future returns, and analysis should be continuously reviewed and adjusted as new information becomes available.

**Overall Assessment:** The use of these techniques provided positive results, reflected in performance metrics and consistent growth of the optimized portfolio over the analyzed period.
